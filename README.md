[Follow this Guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

## package.json

- Ensure "homepage" and the appropriate "scripts" have been added
- Ensure CNAME has been added to `/public` since we are using a custom domain

Then you need to build and let the scripts deploy to the `gh-pages` branch by

npm run deploy
```
